#### Vectors ####

# Create a vector with the c (short for combine) function
c(1, 4, 6, 7)

c(1:5, 10)

# or use a function
# (seq is short for sequence)
seq(1, 10, by = 2)

seq(0, 50, length = 11)

seq(1, 50, length = 11)

1:10 # short for seq(1, 10, by = 1), or just

seq(1, 10)

5:1

# non-integer sequences
#   (Note: the [1] at the beginning of lines indicates
#          the index of the first value in that row)
seq(0, 100*pi, by = pi)
